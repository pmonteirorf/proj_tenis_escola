# Tênis Escola

> Project Status: Completed ✅

This project is dedicated to creating a website for the social project called Tênis Escola, located in Minas Gerais/BR, aimed at transforming the lives of children and young people through sports.


## 🛠️ Technologies

As the website aims to only showcase what is being done in the project, a static website was chosen, using the following technologies::

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML-239120?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS-239120?&style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black">
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Bootstrap-563D7C?style=for-the-badge&logo=bootstrap&logoColor=white"> 

For the Contact page, was used <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-777BB4?style=for-the-badge&logo=php&logoColor=white"> for message sending.


## 📋 Template

As a basis for the website creation, the following template was used:

[UpConstruction - Bootstrap Website Template ](https://bootstrapmade.com/upconstruction-bootstrap-construction-website-template/)


## ⏭️ Next Steps

To avoid HTML code repetition, such as the header and footer of the pages, the project will be migrated to PHP to solve this issue. This process has not been carried out yet, as for easier project testing, it is currently hosted on GitHub Pages, which only accepts static websites.
